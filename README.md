<p><h3 align="center"><b>ABSTRACT</b></h3></p>
<p align="center">Follow along as we take the D3FC0N Hacker Homecoming theme to the next level with a DFIR Report Homecoming Parade. The panel will provide additional context to various DFIR Reports released in the past year. Pick up some tips and tricks to up your game!</p>

<p><h1 align="left">üé≤<b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></h1></p>
The DFIR Report Homecoming Parade will not discuss normal (BAU) CTI actions, such as searching the logs for hits on the IOCs or entering the IOCs into a Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) or other alerting platform. Instead, the participants will focus on pivoting, TTPs, and how they would take the contents in the various DFIR Reports to the NEXT LEVEL! When the Panelists respond to the DFIR Reports, they are operating under the assumption that they performed the preliminary analysis and deemed the threat report relevant to their environment. The purpose of this assumption is to decrease the amount of debate on whether or not something is relevant to get to the part of the analysis that involves extracting actionable takeaways. ü§úüí•ü§õ
